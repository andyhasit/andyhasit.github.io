# Andyhasit's git page repo

This is my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository.

I use it as a hosting space + rapid development platform for my experiments in front end app design.

### Current Focus

22/10/2018 - currently focused on:

* Pillbug - a reactive framework
* Ratherdry - an IndexedDb library (also has its own repo)
* Pointy - an app which uses both the above


### Next steps:

1. Figure out why not working as PWA
2. Get Many to many relationships working - or alt solution
3. Make point logging app
4. keyval (singleton) table

#### Pointy spec:

1. Add entry > dialog > dropdown/new text. For now only one word e.g. Pushups, Novarum, Home organising, Chores etc... plus a score in points.
2. Homescreen: points per day.
3. Data structure


### Rapid development setup

1. Monorepo so separate libs can be developed simultaneously
2. Only use master branch (not branch per project)
3. Publish via Github pages so I can test on mobile
4. One gulp file for all


### Notes:

1. Local dev doesn't work because db doesn't load? I use localhost:101 
2. Use incognito chrome on mobile to avoid cached js
