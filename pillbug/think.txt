    - Use virtual DOM to patch
        https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom

  Better atts:
 

  Think;
    - different types of triggers, not just string but watchers.
    - sort shouldChange when element is reactivated.
    - wrap for namespace

    Redraw mechanism:

        Explicit events
        Watch objects
        Compare
